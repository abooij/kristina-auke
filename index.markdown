### Children at the event
Don't worry, you won't be alone bringing a child to our wedding. There will be a lot of kids!

There will be a playroom with babysitters at the wedding. The babysitters are prepared to take care of and entertain kids older than 2. As a general rule, kids under 2 need to be looked after by an adult even in the playroom. That said, there will be one babysitter prepared to assist parents of babies for shorter periods of time.

In addition to the playroom, there will be a separate sleeping and nursing room available. If you want to have a baby bed prepared for your child, please reach out to us.

### Gifts
There is no expectation to bring a gift.  If you want, you can contribute to the cost of the wedding using the donation box.
