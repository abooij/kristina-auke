Wecome! Our wedding website is still **under construction**. Our goal is to share imporant information about our wedding and hopefully answer questions that many of you might have so please come back in a few weeks.


### Venue
Our whole wedding day will take place in the heart of Prague in [Villa Richter](https://www.villarichter.cz/en/).

### Accommodation
There is unfortunately no accommodation at Villa Richter. **Guests of our wedding get a special offer in [Hotel Hoffmeister](https://www.hoffmeister.cz/en) which is across the street.** The price is 155 EUR for a double room including breakfast. There is also a limited amount of parking places available. If you are interested in staying in Hotel Hoffmeister, please contact us and we will let you know how to book.

Otherwise, we recommend looking for options either in the direct neighborhood or areas easily reachable from metro stop Malostranská, which is on the A metro line (google maps know the Prague public transport well). Here are some concrete suggestions (we don't have personal experience with any of these though):
