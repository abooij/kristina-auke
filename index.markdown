Wecome! Our wedding website is still **under construction**. Our goal is to share imporant information about our wedding and hopefully answer questions that many of you might have so please come back in a few weeks.


### Venue
Our whole wedding day will take place in the heart of Prague in [Villa Richter](https://www.villarichter.cz/en/).

### Arrival 
Villa Richter is 250m from the public transport hub Malostranská (stop of metro A and many trams). We are currectly checking the parking options and will update you later.

### Children at the event
There will be a room for naps and breastfeeding in the villa. More details to follow.
